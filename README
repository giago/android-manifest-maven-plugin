The android-manifest-maven-plugin can be use to manipulate the versions of the android manifest

The manipulation of the manifest is relative to the versionName and versionCode
- versionName is changed accordingly with the maven version
- versionCode is increased by one every time the command is runned

There are two goals, the different is in the way the versionName is managed
- release : in this case the plugin will take the version in the pom and apply it to the manifest without the -SNAPSHOT part
- snapshot : similar to the release but will leave the -SNAPSHOT
